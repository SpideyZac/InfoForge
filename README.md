# What Is InfoForge?
InfoForge is a fast, multi platform data collection tool. InfoForge's goal is to make it easier for developers to collect data to train an Artificial Intelligence Bot on a task
to their liking. It provides an easy UI to choose what kind of data you would like to collect including:

* keyboard inputs
* mouse inputs
* speaker and microphone inputs and outputs
* screenshots 
* any combination of these

It provides compression techniques to reduce space on disk and allows you to change the size of all data captured. All data is unlabled so you can pick which data you would like
to use for inputs and outputs but every index of data represents a frame of all data captured, so every index of data represents one frame and they will all shapes of the data will match. The FPS that this data can be modified as well.

# Why make this program?
Sometimes I find it repetitive to write these data collection scripts and thought it would be a good idea to write a general script so that I don't have to keep rewriting the same data collection scripts over and over. I also wanted to write a script that was fast and efficient so you never have to worry about performance or editing the code.
